    "**Interpretable Machine Learning is the subject which focuses on drawing  insights from a supervised machine learning models. The idea is to unmask the black-box and make the models truth-worthy \
by providing surportive details concerning the outputs of the model. Several techniqes are blended together to describes the general and local overview concerning \
model's performance. Examples of techniques employed include training models that are directly interpretable like linear models and decision trees or\
applying model diagnostic tools such as evaluation of variable importance:**"
